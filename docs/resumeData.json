Proposed subgradient optimization for rectilinear partitioning of sparse matrices and point datasets. Devised and implemented a shared memory code and a hybrid version with MPI using C++11 threads, lock-free data structures and fine-grained parallelism to generate random graphs given a k-core structure, accepted at IPDPSW 2020. Implemented a 2D sparse prefix sum data structure using persistent Binary Indexed Trees to speed up the prefix sum queries in matrixpartitioning algorithms, proposed sparsification idea to make queries much faster and proposed more efficient heuristics for the symmetric rectilinear partitioning problem, accepted at JEA 2021."
